1. Intro                                                          *ctrlsf-intro*

CtrlSF is a tool for project-wide code search and view. It uses ack/ag as its
backend, parses the search result and displays the result in a user-friendly
format. It is developed as an alternative for ack.vim and ag.vim, and as its
name implies, it is inspired by 'Find in Files...' command in Sublime Text 2,
whose shortcut is 'Ctrl+Shift+F'.

An example of CtrlSF search result is like this:
>
    autoload/ctrlsf.vim:
    60-         func! s:Init()
    61-             if !exists('g:ctrlsf_open_left')
    62-                 let g:ctrlsf_open_left = 1
    63:             endif
    64-
    65-             if !exists('g:ctrlsf_ackprg')
    66-                 let g:ctrlsf_ackprg = s:DetectAckprg()

2. Usage                                                          *ctrlsf-usage*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Quick Start                                              *ctrlsf-quickstart*

A typical workflow using CtrlSF is like this:

  1. Run |:CtrlSF| to invoke a search. In most cases you may just want to search
  a literal string, it's as easy like this
>
    :CtrlSF {string}
<
  Then CtrlSF will split a new window to show you result.

  2. Use <h><j><k><l> and other keys to navigate through result, also there
  are two handy maps <C-J> and <C-K> that can move forward to next match or
  backward to previous match.

  3. Press <Enter> if you want to open corresponding file of line under
  cursor.

  4. Or you may need more context, press <p> to open that file in an individual
  preview window.

  5. Or press <q> to quit.

  6. |:CtrlSFOpen| can reopen CtrlSF window when you have closed CtrlSF window.
  It is free because it won't invoke a same but new search. A useful command
  |:CtrlSFToggle| is also available.

  7. If you prefer a quickfix-like result window, just try to press `M` in
  CtrlSF window.

Note: The result set will additionally be stored in a |location-list| of the
CtrlSF window. Open it using |:lopen|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Edit Mode                                                 *ctrlsf-edit-mode*

CtrlSF has an edit mode, in which you can modify result buffer and immediately
apply those changes to files on disk. The following steps show how to use edit
mode:

  1. Search some word to bring up CtrlSF.

  2. Edit as you like in result buffer, and when your change is done, save it
  by |:w|.

  3. CtrlSF will ask you for confirmation about how many files will be
  affected, and if you are sure, input |'y'| or just press |Enter|.

  4. All changes then are saved to files. You can find result buffer is also
  updated to the latest version of files.

  5. If you change your mind later, you can always undo it by pressing
  |u| and saving result buffer again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Examples                                                   *ctrlsf-examples*

  1. Search in a specific sub-directory
>
    :CtrlSF {pattern} /path/to/dir
<
  2. Search case-insensitively
>
    :CtrlSF -I {pattern}
<
  3. Search with regular expression
>
    :CtrlSF -R {regex}
<
  4. Show result with specific context setting
>
    :CtrlSF -A 3 -B 1 {pattern}
<
  5. Search in files with specific extension
>
    :CtrlSF -G .*\.cpp {pattern}
<
================================================================================
3. Commands                                                    *ctrlsf-commands*

:CtrlSF [arguments] {pattern} [path] ...                               *:CtrlSF*

  Search {pattern}. Default is search by literal. Show result in a new CtrlSF
  window if there is no existing one, otherwise reuse that one.

  [arguments] are all valid CtrlSF arguments, see |ctrlsf-arguments| for what
  they are.

  [path] is one or more directories/files where CtrlSF will search. If nothing
  is given, the default directory is used, which is specified by
  |g:ctrlsf_default_root|.

:CtrlSFOpen                                                        *:CtrlSFOpen*

  If CtrlSF window is closed (by <q> or |:CtrlSFClose|), reopen it. If the
  window is already on display, then focus it.

:CtrlSFUpdate                                                    *:CtrlSFUpdate*

  Update CtrlSF result by invoking a new search with same arguments and pattern
  of last one.

:CtrlSFClose                                                      *:CtrlSFClose*

  Close an existing CtrlSF window. If there is no active CtrlSF window, do
  nothing.

:CtrlSFClearHL                                                  *:CtrlSFClearHL*

  If you have turned on |g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl|, use this command to clear
  highlighting on the selected line.

:CtrlSFStop                                                        *:CtrlSFStop*

  Stop a background searching process.

:CtrlSFToggle                                                    *:CtrlSFToggle*

  Open the CtrlSF window if it is closed, or vice versa.

:CtrlSFToggleMap                                              *:CtrlSFToggleMap*

  Toggle CtrlSF's default key mapping. This command can be used in CtrlSF
  window only.

:CtrlSFFocus                                                      *:CtrlSFFocus*

  Move cursor to CtrlS window and focus the first result.

================================================================================
4. Key Maps                                                     *ctrlsf-keymaps*

  Maps to launch CtrlSF:

    <Plug>CtrlSFPrompt      Input 'CtrlSF' in command line and waiting, just a
                            handy shortcut.

    <Plug>CtrlSFVwordPath    Input current visual selected word in command line
                             and waiting for any other user input.

    <Plug>CtrlSFVwordExec    Similar to above, but execute it immediately.

    <Plug>CtrlSFCwordPath    Input word in the cursor in command line and
                             waiting.

    <Plug>CtrlSFCwordExec    Similar to above, but execute it immediately.

    <Plug>CtrlSFCCwordPath   Similar to <Plug>CtrlSFCwordPath but will add word
                             boundary around searching word.

    <Plug>CtrlSFCCwordExec   Similar to above, but execute it immediately.

    <Plug>CtrlSFPwordPath    Input last search pattern in command line and
                             waiting.

    <Plug>CtrlSFPwordExec    Similar to above, but execute it immediately.

  Maps by default in CtrlSF window:

    <Enter>, <o>, <2-LeftMouse> Open file which contains the line under cursor.

    <C-O>          Open file in a horizontally split window.

    <p>            Open a preview window to view file.

    <P>            Open a preview window to view file and switch focus to it.

    <O>            Like <o>, but always leave CtrlSF window open.

    <T>            Like <t>, but focus CtrlSF window instead of opened new tab.

    <q>            Quit CtrlSF. Also close preview window if any.

    <C-C>          Stop running asynchronous searching.

    <C-J>          Move cursor to next match.

    <C-K>          Move cursor to previous match.

6. Options                                                      *ctrlsf-options*

g:ctrlsf_absolute_file_path                      *'g:ctrlsf_absolute_file_path'*
Default: 0
'g:ctrlsf_absolute_file_path' defines whether CtrlSF uses absolute path or
relative path (if possible) for files. This option is automatically applied if
'autochdir' is enabled.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_absolute_file_path = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_ackprg                                              *'g:ctrlsf_ackprg'*
Default: auto
Available: 'ag', 'ack', 'pt', 'rg'
'g:ctrlsf_ackprg' defines the path of ack/ag which CtrlSF will use as its
backend. If nothing is given, CtrlSF will try to figure out a proper backend.
Preferred order is 'ag' > 'ack' > 'rg' > 'pt' > 'ack-grep'. You can also
explicitly set it by
>
    let g:ctrlsf_ackprg = '/usr/local/bin/ag'
<
g:ctrlsf_auto_close                                      *'g:ctrlsf_auto_close'*
Default:
    {
        "normal" : 1,
        "compact": 0
    }
'g:ctrlsf_auto_close' defines how CtrlSF handles itself in 'normal' and 'compact'
view mode(|g:ctrlsf_default_view_mode|) respectively after you have opened a file
from CtrlSF window. By default, CtrlSF will close itself in 'normal' view mode and
keep open in 'compact' view mode.
You can customize it as you will:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_auto_close = {
        \ "normal" : 0,
        \ "compact": 0
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_auto_focus                                      *'g:ctrlsf_auto_focus'*
Default:
    {
        "at" : "none"
    }
'g:ctrlsf_auto_focus' defines which timing CtrlSF should focus result pane when
working in async search mode. There are 3 possible value: 'none', 'start' and
'done'. 'none' makes CtrlSF not focus at all, 'start' makes CtrlSF focus at
search starting, 'done' makes CtrlSF focus at search finished, but ONLY for
those immediately finished search. An additional option 'duration_less_than'
is available for 'done', only searches finished within this timeout will be
focused. When you have set 'at' to 'done' but not set 'duration_less_than', a
default value '1000' will be used. Time unit for 'duration_less_than' is
millisecond.
Example:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_auto_focus = {
        \ "at" : "done",
        \ "duration_less_than": 1000
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive                              *'g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive'*
Default: 'smart'
Available: 'smart', 'yes', 'no'
Defines the default case-sensitivity in search. Possible values are 'yes',
'no' and 'smart'. 'yes' and 'no' works exactly as its meaning. 'smart' means
smart-case, which is as same as it is in Vim.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive = 'no'
<
g:ctrlsf_confirm_save                                  *'g:ctrlsf_confirm_save'*
Default: 1
Confirm before saving your changes to file. If you are tired of typing 'yes',
you can turn off this confirmation by
>
    let g:ctrlsf_confirm_save = 0
<
g:ctrlsf_confirm_unsaving_quit                *'g:ctrlsf_confirm_unsaving_quit'*
Default: 1
Confirm before quitting if there is any unsaved change. Usually it can protect
you from occasionally pressing 'q' then all changes blow off. You can disable
this protection by
>
    let g:ctrlsf_confirm_unsaving_quit = 0
<
g:ctrlsf_context                                            *'g:ctrlsf_context'*
Default: '-C 3'
Defines how many lines around the matching line will be printed. Use same format
as its counterpart in Ag/Ack.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_context = '-B 5 -A 3'
<
g:ctrlsf_debug_mode                                      *'g:ctrlsf_debug_mode'*
Default: 0
Verbose informations will be printed if you turn this option on. It's useful
when something does not work as you expected.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_debug_mode = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_default_root                                  *'g:ctrlsf_default_root'*
Default: 'cwd'
Available: 'cwd', 'project', 'project+xx'
Defines how CtrlSF works if no explicit search path is given. Possible value
is 'cwd','project' and 'project+xx'.('xx' is two sub-options for 'project'.)

Explanation for each option:

'cwd'         - Use current working directory.
'project'     - CtrlSF will try to find project root from current file to
                its ancestors. A project root is a directory with VCS
                folder is placed in. Currently CtrlSF can recognize .git,
                .hg, .svn, .bzr, _darcs.
'project+xx'  - Same as 'project'. But you can have more control about how
                project directory is found and fallback root if no project
                root is found.

    First 'x' defines from where to search project root. It has 2 possible
    values:
        'f' - search from current file.
        'w' - search from current working directory.

    Second 'x' defines the fallback search root for the case project root is
    not found. It has 2 possible values:
        'f' - current file is fallback search root.
        'w' - current working directory is fallback search root.

    Option 'project' is identical to 'project+ff'.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_default_root = 'project+fw'
<
g:ctrlsf_default_view_mode                        *'g:ctrlsf_default_view_mode'*
Default: 'normal'
Available: 'normal', 'compact'
Defines default view mode of CtrlSF result window. 'normal' is a Sublime-like
view and 'compact' is a quickfix-like view.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_default_view_mode = 'compact'
<
g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args                      *'g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args'*
Default: {}
Defines extra arguments that will be passed **literally** to backend. It's
useful when you are needing backend-specific features. Acceptable keys are
'ack', 'ag', 'pt', 'rg'.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args = {
        \ 'pt': '--home-ptignore'
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_extra_root_markers                      *'g:ctrlsf_extra_root_markers'*
Default: []
Defines a list of root markers that helps CtrlSF recognizing project root. For
example, this option is set '[".root"]', and there exists a file or directory
'/home/your/project/.root', then '/home/your/project' will be recognized as
project root.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_extra_root_markers = ['.root']
<
g:ctrlsf_follow_symlinks                            *'g:ctrlsf_follow_symlinks'*
Default: 1
Defines whether the backend should follow symbolic links or not.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_follow_symlinks = 0
<
g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir                                      *'g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir'*
Default: ''
Defines directories that will be ignored by default. It's useful for backend
that does not respect to '.gitignore'.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir = ['bower_components', 'node_modules']
<
g:ctrlsf_indent                                              *'g:ctrlsf_indent'*
Default: 4
Defines how many spaces are placed between line number and line content. You

g:ctrlsf_mapping                                            *'g:ctrlsf_mapping'*
Defines keys for mapping in result window. Sometimes you may find default
mapping of CtrlSF conflict with keys you have been used to sometimes, especially
in editing.  Then you can change default mapping by setting this option. A
subset of available methods is valid, those unspecified methods will use default
keys. You can also disable a method by mapping it to an empty string.

Key id and its functionality:
>
    open    - open file.
    openb   - open file in background.
    split   - split window horizontally then open file.
    vsplit  - split window vertically then open file.
    tab     - open file in a new tab.
    tabb    - open file in a background new tab.
    popen   - open preview window.
    popenf  - open preview window in foreground.
    quit    - close main window.
    next    - jump to next match.
    prev    - jump to previous match.
    pquit   - close preview window.
    loclist - open location list in main window.
    chgmode - switch view mode.
    stop    - stop running asynchronous searching.
<
Default:
>
    {
        "open"    : ["<CR>", "o"],
        "openb"   : "O",
        "split"   : "<C-O>",
        "vsplit"  : "",
        "tab"     : "t",
        "tabb"    : "T",
        "popen"   : "p",
        "popenf"  : "P",
        "quit"    : "q",
        "next"    : "<C-J>",
        "prev"    : "<C-K>",
        "pquit"   : "q",
        "loclist" : "",
        "chgmode" : "M",
        "stop"    : "<C-C>",
    }

Sometimes you may wish for a method to also perform a complementary action such
as scrolling the window, or returning focus to the CtrlSF window. In that case
you can specify the method's value as a dictionary with a 'key' and a 'suffix',
which contains the additional keys to execute after the method. In the following
example, 'suffix' will return focus to the CtrlSF window after 'openb' is
executed.

Example:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_mapping = {
        \ "openb": { key: "O", suffix: "<C-w>p" },
        \ "next": "n",
        \ "prev": "N",
        \ "openb": "",
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_parse_speed                                    *'g:ctrlsf_parse_speed'*
Default: 300
The count of lines which CtrlSF will parse in every 200 milliseconds. If you
find the default value is too large and make your Vim slow during asynchronous
searching, you can set it a more moderate value:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_parse_speed = 100
<
g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist                            *'g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist'*
Default: 0
Defines whether CtrlSF will feed quickfix and location list with search result.
If you are used to vim builtin quickfix list and want to use |:cnext|,
|:cprevious| for navigation, then you can set this option to 1:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_position                                          *'g:ctrlsf_position'*
Default: 'left'
Available: 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'
By default CtrlSF window will be opened at left. You can also specify for it to
be opened 'top', 'right', or 'bottom'. E.g.:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_position = 'bottom'
<
g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern                                *'g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern'*
Default: 0
Default case-sensitivity used in search. Default value 0 means CtrlSF search
pattern literally, if you want CtrlSF use regular expression by default (like
Ack/Ag), you can set it to 1.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_search_mode                                    *'g:ctrlsf_search_mode'*
Default: 'async' for version 8.0+, 'sync' for others
Available: 'sync', 'async'
Defines whether CtrlSF works in a synchronous or an asynchronous way. Note
that 'async' is only supported for Vim with version above 8.0.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_search_mode = 'async'
<
g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl                          *'g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl'*
Default: 'p'
Highlight matching line in the target file. It is useful especially in preview
mode. The value of this option is a flag-map including following valid
flags:
>
    'o' : highlight matching line in the target file after file is opened.
    'p' : highlight matching line in preview window.
<
If you want to enable this feature both in preview window and actual file, you
can set it as
>
    let g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl = 'op'
<
g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key                                *'g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key'*
Default: ''
Key to temporarily enable/disable CtrlSF's default key mapping. By default
this value is empty, means no key is mapped for this feature.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key = '\t'
<
g:ctrlsf_winsize                                                *'g:ctrlsf_width'*
Default: 'auto'
Available: 'auto', 'xx%', 'xx'
Size of CtrlSF window. This is its width if the window opens vertically (to the
left or right), or height if it opens horizontally (above or below). It accepts
string as its value and there are 3 types of argument:
>
    'auto' : half of current vim window size.
    'xx%'  : xx percent of current vim window size.
    'xx'   : absolute size in characters.
<
Example:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_winsize = '30%'
<
g:CtrlSFAfterMainWindowInit                      *'g:CtrlSFAfterMainWindowInit'*
Default: None
'g:CtrlSFAfterMainWindowInit' defines a function will be called after CtrlSF
window initialized. It can be used to override default window setting.
>
    function! g:CtrlSFAfterMainWindowInit()
        setl wrap
    endfunction
