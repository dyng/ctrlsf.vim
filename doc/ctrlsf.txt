1. Intro                                                          *ctrlsf-intro*

CtrlSF is a tool for project-wide code search and view. It uses ack/ag as its
backend, parses the search result and displays the result in a user-friendly
format. It is developed as an alternative for ack.vim and ag.vim, and as its
name implies, it is inspired by 'Find in Files...' command in Sublime Text 2,
whose shortcut is 'Ctrl+Shift+F'.

An example of CtrlSF search result is like this:
>
    autoload/ctrlsf.vim:
    60-         func! s:Init()
    61-             if !exists('g:ctrlsf_open_left')
    62-                 let g:ctrlsf_open_left = 1
    63:             endif
    64-
    65-             if !exists('g:ctrlsf_ackprg')
    66-                 let g:ctrlsf_ackprg = s:DetectAckprg()

2. Usage                                                          *ctrlsf-usage*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Quick Start                                              *ctrlsf-quickstart*

A typical workflow using CtrlSF is like this:

  1. Run |:CtrlSF| to invoke a search. In most cases you may just want to search
  a literal string, it's as easy like this
>
    :CtrlSF {string}
<
  Then CtrlSF will split a new window to show you result.

  2. Use <h><j><k><l> and other keys to navigate through result, also there
  are two handy maps <C-J> and <C-K> that can move forward to next match or
  backward to previous match.

  3. Press <Enter> if you want to open corresponding file of line under
  cursor.

  4. Or you may need more context, press <p> to open that file in an individual
  preview window.

  5. Or press <q> to quit.

  6. |:CtrlSFOpen| can reopen CtrlSF window when you have closed CtrlSF window.
  It is free because it won't invoke a same but new search. A useful command
  |:CtrlSFToggle| is also available.

  7. Alternatively run `:CtrlSFQuickfix [pattern]`, it will only open a
  quickfix window to show search results.

Note: The result set will additionally be stored in a |location-list| of the
CtrlSF window. Open it using |:lopen|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Edit Mode                                                 *ctrlsf-edit-mode*

CtrlSF has an edit mode, in which you can modify result buffer and immediately
apply those changes to files on disk. The following steps show how to use edit
mode:

  1. Search some word to bring up CtrlSF.

  2. Edit as you like in result buffer, and when your change is done, save it
  by |:w|.

  3. CtrlSF will ask you for confirmation about how many files will be
  affected, and if you are sure, input |'y'| or just press |Enter|.

  4. All changes then are saved to files. You can find result buffer is also
  updated to the latest version of files.

  5. If you change your mind later, you can always undo it by pressing
  |u| and saving result buffer again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Examples                                                   *ctrlsf-examples*

  1. Search in a specific sub-directory
>
    :CtrlSF {pattern} /path/to/dir
<
  2. Search case-insensitively
>
    :CtrlSF -I {pattern}
<
  3. Search with regular expression
>
    :CtrlSF -R {regex}
<
  4. Show result with specific context setting
>
    :CtrlSF -A 3 -B 1 {pattern}
<
  5. Search in files with specific extension
>
    :CtrlSF -G .*\.cpp {pattern}
<
================================================================================
3. Commands                                                    *ctrlsf-commands*

:CtrlSF [arguments] {pattern} [path] ...                               *:CtrlSF*

  Search {pattern}. Default is search by literal. Show result in a new CtrlSF
  window if there is no existing one, otherwise reuse that one.

  [arguments] are all valid CtrlSF arguments, see |ctrlsf-arguments| for what
  they are.

  [path] is one or more directories/files where CtrlSF will search. If nothing
  is given, the default directory is used, which is specified by
  |g:ctrlsf_default_root|.

:CtrlSFQuickfix [arguments] {pattern} [path] ...               *:CtrlSFQuickfix*

  Similar to |:CtrlSF|. Search {pattern}. Default is search by literal. Show
  result in a quickfix window if there is no existing one, otherwise reuse
  that one.

:CtrlSFOpen                                                        *:CtrlSFOpen*

  If CtrlSF window is closed (by <q> or |:CtrlSFClose|), reopen it. If the
  window is already on display, then focus it.

:CtrlSFUpdate                                                    *:CtrlSFUpdate*

  Update CtrlSF result by invoking a new search with same arguments and pattern
  of last one.

:CtrlSFClose                                                      *:CtrlSFClose*

  Close an existing CtrlSF window. If there is no active CtrlSF window, do
  nothing.

:CtrlSFClearHL                                                  *:CtrlSFClearHL*

  If you have turned on |g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl|, use this command to clear
  highlighting on the selected line.

:CtrlSFToggle                                                    *:CtrlSFToggle*

  Open the CtrlSF window if it is closed, or vice versa.

:CtrlSFToggleMap                                              *:CtrlSFToggleMap*

  Toggle CtrlSF's default key mapping. This command can be used in CtrlSF
  window only.

================================================================================
4. Key Maps                                                     *ctrlsf-keymaps*

6. Options                                                      *ctrlsf-options*

g:ctrlsf_ackprg                                              *'g:ctrlsf_ackprg'*
Default: auto
'g:ctrlsf_ackprg' defines the path of ack/ag which CtrlSF will use as its
backend. If nothing is given, CtrlSF will try 'ag' first and fallback to
'ack' if 'ag' is not available. You can also explicitly set it by
>
    let g:ctrlsf_ackprg = '/usr/local/bin/ag'
<
g:ctrlsf_auto_close                                      *'g:ctrlsf_auto_close'*
Default: 1
'g:ctrlsf_auto_close' defines how CtrlSF handle itself after you have opened
a file from CtrlSF window. By default CtrlSF will close itself but you can
prevent this behavior by setting this option to 0
>
    let g:ctrlsf_auto_close = 0
<
g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive                              *'g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive'*
Default: 'smart'
Defines the default case-sensitivity in search. Possible values are 'yes',
'no' and 'smart'. 'yes' and 'no' works exactly as its meaning. 'smart' means
smart-case, which is as same as it is in Vim.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_case_sensitive = 'no'
<
g:ctrlsf_confirm_save                                  *'g:ctrlsf_confirm_save'*
Default: 1
Confirm before saving your changes to file. If you are tired of typing 'yes',
you can turn off this confirmation by
>
    let g:ctrlsf_confirm_save = 0
<
g:ctrlsf_context                                            *'g:ctrlsf_context'*
Default: '-C 3'
Defines how many lines around the matching line will be printed. Use same format
as its counterpart in Ag/Ack.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_context = '-B 5 -A 3'
<
g:ctrlsf_debug_mode                                      *'g:ctrlsf_debug_mode'*
Default: 0
Verbose informations will be printed if you turn this option on. It's useful
when something does not work as you expected.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_debug_mode = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_default_root                                  *'g:ctrlsf_default_root'*
Default: 'cwd'
Defines how CtrlSF works if no explicit search path is given. Possible value
is 'cwd' and 'project'. With 'cwd', CtrlSF uses current working directory as
its search root. With 'project', CtrlSF will try to find project root of
current file and use it. A project root is a directory which VCS folder is
placed in, currently CtrlSF can recognize .git, .hg, .svn, .bzr, _darcs.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_default_root = 'project'
<
g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args                      *'g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args'*
Default: {}
Defines extra arguments that will be passed **literally** to backend. It's
useful when you are needing backend-specific features. Acceptable keys are
'ack', 'ag', 'pt'.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_extra_backend_args = {
        \ 'pt': '--home-ptignore'
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir                                      *'g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir'*
Default: ''
Defines directories that will be ignored by default. It's useful for backend
that does not respect to '.gitignore'.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_ignore_dir = ['bower_components', 'npm_modules']
<

g:ctrlsf_indent                                              *'g:ctrlsf_indent'*
Default: 4
Defines how many spaces are placed between line number and line content. You
can set a sane small value for more compact view.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_indent = 2
<
g:ctrlsf_mapping                                            *'g:ctrlsf_mapping'*
Defines keys for mapping in result window. Sometimes you may find default
mapping of CtrlSF conflict with keys you have been used to sometimes, especially
in editing.  Then you can change default mapping by setting this option. A
subset of available methods is valid, those unspecified methods will use default
keys. You can also disable a method by mapping it to an empty string.

Default:
>
    {
        "open"    : ["<CR>", "o"],
        "openb"   : "O",
        "split"   : "<C-O>",
        "tab"     : "t",
        "tabb"    : "T",
        "popen"   : "p",
        "quit"    : "q",
        "next"    : "<C-J>",
        "prev"    : "<C-K>",
        "pquit"   : "q",
        "loclist" : "",
    }
<
Example:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_mapping = {
        \ "next": "n",
        \ "prev": "N",
        \ "openb": "",
        \ }
<
g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist                            *'g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist'*
Default: 0
Defines whether CtrlSF will feed quickfix and location list with search result.
If you are used to vim builtin quickfix list and want to use |:cnext|,
|:cprevious| for navigation, then you can set this option to 1:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_populate_qflist = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_position                                          *'g:ctrlsf_position'*
Default: 'left'
By default CtrlSF window will be opened at left. You can also specify for it to
be opened 'top', 'right', or 'bottom'. E.g.:
>
    let g:ctrlsf_position = 'bottom'
<
g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern                                *'g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern'*
Default: 0
Default case-sensitivity used in search. Default value 0 means CtrlSF search
pattern literally, if you want CtrlSF use regular expression by default (like
Ack/Ag), you can set it to 1.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_regex_pattern = 1
<
g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl                          *'g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl'*
Default: 'p'
Highlight matching line in the target file. It is useful especially in preview
mode. The value of this option is a flag-map including following valid
flags:
>
    'o' : highlight matching line in the target file after file is opened.
    'p' : highlight matching line in preview window.
<
If you want to enable this feature both in preview window and actual file, you
can set it as
>
    let g:ctrlsf_selected_line_hl = 'op'
<
g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key                                *'g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key'*
Default: ''
Key to temporarily enable/disable CtrlSF's default key mapping. By default
this value is empty, means no key is mapped for this feature.
>
    let g:ctrlsf_toggle_map_key = '\t'
<

g:ctrlsf_winsize                                                *'g:ctrlsf_width'*
Default: 'auto'
Size of CtrlSF window. This is its width if the window opens vertically (to the
left or right), or height if it opens horizontally (above or below). It accepts
string as its value and there are 3 types of argument:
>
    'auto' : half of current vim window size.
    'xx%'  : xx percent of current vim window size.
    'xx'   : absolute size in characters.
